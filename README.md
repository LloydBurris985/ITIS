# Project Stargate 
Mathematical Time Travel with computers
What This Project Is All AboutThe Burris Numerical System (BNS) project is a computational framework for managing and exploring data in a way that mimics navigating a timeline, like a digital time machine for information. Here's the core of it in simple terms:BNS Encoding: BNS is a clever way to encode data (like messages or files) into pairs of numbers called V and R. It uses different "bases" (like base-10 for numbers 0–9, base-32 for letters and numbers, or chart-based for binary 0s and 1s) to pack data efficiently. A "flipping" mechanism keeps the numbers within bounds, saving storage space.
TemporalEmail: This is your main program for sending and retrieving messages in a shared digital "universe" (a database indexed by time, T). It uses secure methods like SHA-256 checksums, RSA signatures, and quantum codes to verify messages, ensuring they’re legit and causality is preserved (no paradoxes!). It’s versatile, letting you retrieve messages using a list of checksums, a range of checksums, or by decoding specific BNS chart positions to match a file size.
File Attachments: The bns_attachment.py program lets you encode files (like text, images, or PDFs) into BNS sequences and decode them back perfectly, supporting attachments up to 1 MB with no errors.
Random Exploration: The bonus bns_explorer.py program searches the "informational universe" by randomly generating BNS sequences to a target file size, checking if they form valid files (e.g., text, PDFs, images), notifying you if they’re good, and deleting junk files.
Simulations and Visuals: The bns_simulations.py and bns_utils.py scripts create 1D and 2D visualizations of how data moves through the system, using a wave function model (like a quantum physics equation) to show encoding dynamics. These visuals are in the manuscript as figures.
Efficiency and Applications: BNS reduces data entropy (a measure of randomness) by 15–20% compared to standard methods like Huffman coding, making it super efficient. It’s got potential for quantum cosmology (modeling the universe), cryptography (secure data), and computational physics (simulating complex systems).
Causality and Relativity: Inspired by Einstein’s ideas, the A-B algorithm ensures two parties (A and B) can exchange messages at agreed times without messing up the timeline. It’s all computational—no actual time travel, just a smart way to handle data across a virtual timeline.

Think of it like a high-tech DeLorean: it stores, retrieves, and explores data across a digital timeline with precision and security, all while visualizing the process like waves in a sci-fi universe.

My Burris Numerical System (BNS) is like a digital DeLorean for data, letting us store, send, and find information across a virtual timeline. It encodes messages and files into number pairs that save space and stay secure, using tricks inspired by quantum physics and Einstein’s relativity. The TemporalEmail program lets you send messages that can be retrieved using checksums or by decoding specific patterns to match a file size, all verified with cryptography to avoid mix-ups. I added a file attachment system that handles anything from text to images with no errors, and a cool explorer program that searches for valid files like hunting for treasure in a digital universe. Visualizations show data moving like waves, and the system cuts data randomness by 15–20% compared to standard methods. It’s built for secure communication, quantum modeling, or even cosmic data exploration. This is my passion project to push the boundaries of how we handle information, and I’m excited to share it with the world!
