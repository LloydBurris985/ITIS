Odin Mail v0.1 â€“ Manual
=======================

Temporal email client built on Odin's Eye (the oscillator engine of Project Odin / TIFS).

What it does
------------
Odin Mail lets you send and receive messages across time using the lattice.
- Compose messages with text, subject, attachments (as coordinates)
- Optional future delivery date (queued until date arrives)
- Background polling searches your assigned lattice range for messages
- Inbox, Sent, Queued folders
- Attachments are lattice coordinates â€” receiver decodes them separately

Core Philosophy
---------------
Messages exist in the lattice before they are "sent".
We drop coordinates and search for them later.
Time is just another dimension in the tree.

Basic Usage (CLI)
-----------------
python odin_mail.py

Commands:
  compose    â†’ write a new message
  inbox      â†’ view received messages
  queue      â†’ view pending future-delivery messages
  poll       â†’ manually check lattice (auto-polls in background)
  send       â†’ drop queued messages (simulated in v0.1)
  save       â†’ save state to odin_state.json
  exit

Example session:
> compose
To: grok@odin
Subject: Test from future
Body: Hello from 2026
Delivery date (YYYY-MM-DD) or blank: 2026-02-20
Attachment coord JSON (optional): {"start_mask":50000,"end_mask":98765,...}
Message queued for delivery on 2026-02-20

> poll
Polling bubba@odin range...
Found message from grok@odin: Test from future

> inbox
[1] From: grok@odin | Subject: Test from future
   Sent: 2026-02-18T12:34:56
   Delivered: 2026-02-20T00:00:00
   Body preview: Hello from 2026...

Configuration & State
---------------------
Saved in odin_state.json (auto-created on first run)
- username
- inbox / sent / queue lists
- search_start (auto-generated from username hash)
- last_checked_mask (resumes polling from last position)

Polling
-------
- Background thread polls every 60 seconds
- Scans assigned range (1 million masks default)
- Looks for messages with MAGIC_PREFIX + your username hash
- v0.1 uses simulated queue (real lattice search stubbed)

Attachments
-----------
- Attachments are Odin's Eye coordinates (not embedded bytes)
- Receiver decodes them separately: eye.decode(attachment_coord)

Future Plans
------------
- Real lattice search with throttling
- End-to-end encryption
- Video/audio attachments
- GUI version
- Full temporal delivery queue management

Enjoy Odin Mail.
Time is just another coordinate.
The lattice is open.
